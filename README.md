# My Personal Website - Based on Kross Jekyll

This is my personal website, designed to showcase my projects, experience, and more. It is based on the **Kross Jekyll Creative Portfolio Template**, a clean and minimalist design ported from the [Kross HTML Template](https://themefisher.com/products/kross/).

## Demo

You can visit my website here: [https://mariorht.github.io/](https://mariorht.github.io/)

## About the Template

The **Kross Jekyll** template was created by [Themefisher](https://themefisher.com). It provides a professional and responsive solution for personal or creative portfolios. I have customized this template to suit my needs.

## Customization

I’ve tailored several sections of the template to reflect my personal style and work. If you want to use this template, here are the sections you can easily customize through the `_data/settings.yml` file without modifying any HTML or CSS:

- General theme settings (name, logo, email, phone, address).
- Hero Section.
- About Section.
- Skills Section.
- Experience Section.
- Education Section.
- Portfolio Section.
- Testimonials Section.
- Contact Section.

For more information on how to customize the template, check out the official repository: [Kross Jekyll GitHub](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll).


## How to Use the Template

1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**: You can fork the Kross Jekyll repository and adapt it to your needs.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Once you’ve made your changes, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings. This will make your site live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.
3. **Customization**: Edit the `_data/settings.yml` file to add your information and personalize the content.
4. **Local Server**: If you want to preview changes locally before publishing:
   - Install dependencies using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker-compose run bundler
     ```
   - Start the local server with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to see your site running.
