I am Mario Roos Hoefgeest Toribio, a passionate and experienced C++ Software Engineer specializing in computer vision and industrial inspection. With over 7 years of expertise, I have developed cutting-edge solutions for complex problems, leading projects that integrate advanced technologies like laser triangulation sensors, embedded systems, and distributed architectures.

Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in 3D inspection systems for large-scale and intricate geometries, I am driven by the challenge of merging theoretical research with practical applications. I thrive in collaborative environments, employing modern workflows like CI/CD pipelines, Dockerized environments, and agile methodologies to deliver robust and scalable software solutions.

Whether designing real-time defect detection systems or innovating processes for industrial automation, my commitment lies in pushing the boundaries of efficiency and accuracy. Beyond work, I am an avid learner and problem solver, always seeking to refine my skills and contribute to impactful projects.
