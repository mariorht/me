I am Mario Roos Hoefgeest Toribio, a C++ Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in computer vision and industrial inspection. My expertise includes developing solutions for challenging problems, using technologies like laser triangulation, conoscopic holography, embedded systems, and distributed architectures.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. focused on 3D inspection systems for large-scale and complex geometries, combining theoretical research with real-world applications. I work well in collaborative environments, leveraging modern workflows such as CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and agile methodologies to deliver reliable and scalable software.

From designing real-time defect detection systems to improving industrial automation processes, I aim to create solutions that are both efficient and accurate. I am always learning and looking to contribute to meaningful projects that drive innovation.


Outside of work, I am passionate about both sports and technology. On the sports side, I enjoy activities like bouldering, football, surfing, and triathlons. I started participating in triathlons last year and find them a great way to stay active and challenge myself.  

In technology, I have a strong interest in cybersecurity, having completed introductory pentesting courses and explored platforms like TryHackMe to deepen my understanding.  

I also enjoy working on personal projects that let me experiment with technology. I built my own 3D printer from scratch, customizing the firmware to suit my needs. Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked on home automation, creating a custom system to control lighting and blinds through a locally hosted server on a Raspberry Pi. These projects let me combine creativity and technical problem-solving, fueling my curiosity and passion for innovation.
